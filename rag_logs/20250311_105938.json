    "What's the cutting speed for turning 1.4125 steel with D60 tool?": "{'result': Answer(questioned_parameter='Cutting Speed', tool_range='70-170 m/min', metal_range='20-30 m/min', combined_range='conflicted', thoughts=\"The cutting speed for 1.4125/AISI 440C martensitic stainless steel is approximately 20-30 m/min according to the metal source due to its difficult machinability. The D60 tool source suggests a higher range of 70-170 m/min for stainless steel. Given the high hardness and wear resistance of 440C, the conservative approach would be to follow the lower range from the metal source to prevent tool wear and ensure better machinability. It is advisable to prioritize the metal's recommendation due to its specific characteristics.\"), 'is_successful': True}",
    "What's the cutting depth for turning 1.4125 steel with D60 tool?": "{'result': Answer(questioned_parameter='Cutting Depth', tool_range='0.1 - 0.3 mm', metal_range='0.15 - 0.25 mm', combined_range='conflicted', thoughts=\"There is a conflict between the cutting depth recommendations; the tool source advises a range of 0.1 - 0.3 mm, while the metal source suggests 0.15 - 0.25 mm. The metal's machinability is only fair, indicating careful depth selection. I recommend using the more conservative range from the metal source, 0.15 - 0.25 mm, to ensure stability and prevent tool damage.\"), 'is_successful': True}"
